                    Business to Business (B2B): B2B ecommerce transactions are those
                     where both the transacting parties are businesses, 
                    e.g., manufacturers, traders, retailers and the like.

                Online storefront. This can include a multitude of 
                products such as jewelry, books, home decor items, clothing, 
                or.anything used by individuals in their personal lives.t
                A B2B business is one that offers products or services directly to other businesses. The business can be the end buyer, such as when a company hires a copywriter (the copywriter is the B2B business) or it can be a source of the business. For example, drop shippers provide products to other companies who then sell them to the end user. The drop shipper is a B2B company selling 
                their goods to B2C businesses.

                Some businesses may operate as both B2C and B2B businesses.
                For example, a daycare business may be open to the public but may also provide special arrangements to care for the children of employees of a local business as a group. Or office stores, 
                such as Staples, which offers supplies for both businesses and individuals (such as students).
